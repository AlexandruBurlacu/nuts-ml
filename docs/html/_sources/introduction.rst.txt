Introduction
============

Data pre-processing software for machine learning tasks tends to grown into an
unstructured, monolithic code base that is difficult to read or change and
prone to errors.

**nuts-ml** is a library for data pre-processing that provides common
pre-processing functions as independent units, so called 'nuts'. Nuts can be
freely arranged to build complex data flows that are efficient,
easy to understand and easy to change.

The following example gives a taste of a nuts data-flow:

.. code:: python

   train_samples >> Stratify(1) >> Pick(0.1) >> read_image >> \
      crop >> augment >> Shuffle(100) >> normalize >> \
      build_batch >> network.train() >> log_train >> \
      Print('train loss:{} acc:{}') >> Collect()

**nuts-ml** is based on `nuts-flow <https://github.com/maet3608/nuts-flow>`_
and reading its `documentation <https://maet3608.github.io/nuts-flow/>`_ is
recommended.
